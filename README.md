# Diwali_sales

In this project, I analyzed a Diwali sales dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

-Cleaned the data by dropping null and irrelevant columns.

-Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer purchasing behavior.

-Analyzed sales based on gender, age group, marital status, occupation, state, and product categories.

-Found that most buyers are married women aged 26â€“35 from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.

-Most sold product categories were Food, Clothing, and Electronics.

-High-spending customers mostly work in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors.
